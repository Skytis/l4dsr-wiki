# Linux Setup

Note: Everything here should also work for L4D1 (1.0 or Newest), but is untested.

## Method 1 (easy way, directly in the bat)

*Use this method unless you have a specific reason not to*

Tested by Osku on Ubuntu 22.04 (Wayland) on 2024-11-08
Tested by Skytis on Kubuntu 24.04 LTS (x11) on 2024-11-08 with Proton 9.0-3
Tested by Skytis on Kubuntu 24.10 (Wayland) (clean install) on 2024-11-08 with Proton Experimental

Note: Skytis tried this previously (around July/August 2024) with aciidz' assistance and couldn't get it to work. Osku tried this on 2024-11-08 and it worked. Skytis tried it again the same day and it also worked for him. No idea why

### Steps

* Acquire the desired old version of L4D2 from the [L4D Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/JAUCEJmm2H) (in this guide 2.0.0.0 is used), unzip somewhere
* Acquire LiveSplit, unzip somewhere
* Edit the `Start L4D2.2000.bat` to add LiveSplit to it
  * In this example you have a folder called "Games" which has the folders "L4D2 2.0.0.0" (this contains `Start L4D2.2000.bat`) and "livesplit" (this contains `LiveSplit.exe`)
  * Add these lines (adjust according to your folder structure/LiveSplit location)
    * `cd ..`
    * `cd ..`
    * `start livesplit\Livesplit.exe`
* Add `Start L4D2.2000.bat` as Non-Steam game to Steam
  * Add some other .exe then edit it to point to the .bat since you can't add the .bat directly
* Under Compatibility force a specific compatibility tool select a Proton version (I used 9.0-3)
* Launch the bat-Steam-game
* Wait for the game and LiveSplit to start
* Verify that SST works (check for the console output or see if sst commands can be autocompleted)
  * If it crashes or SST doesn't work, use SST v0.5, v0.6-v0.8 don't work on Linux (v0.9 is not released as of 2024-11-20 but likely will work again)

* Configure LiveSplit and verify that it works

## Method 2 (complicated way, SteamTinkerLaunch)

*Use this method if method 1 doesn't work or if you know what you're doing and want to tinker with more stuff*

Tested by Skytis on Kubuntu 24.04 LTS (x11) on 2024-11-02 with the latest versions of STL and pacstall available and proton-9.0-3c (via STL)

### Steps

* Acquire the desired old version of L4D2 from the [L4D Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/JAUCEJmm2H) (in this guide 2.0.0.0 is used), unzip somewhere
* Acquire LiveSplit, unzip somewhere
* Install SteamTinkerLaunch [https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch](https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch)
  * It is not available via a native repository for (K)ubuntu. Install https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall and then run `pacstall -I steamtinkerlaunch-git`
    * UPPER CASE i (for install), NOT LOWER CASE L
* Add STL as compatibility tool [https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Steam-Compatibility-Tool](https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Steam-Compatibility-Tool)
  * Should just need to run `steamtinkerlaunch compat add`
  * Restart Steam
* Add `Start L4D2.2000.bat` as Non-Steam game to Steam
  * Add some other .exe then edit it to point to the .bat since you can't add the .bat directly
* Under Compatibility force a specific compatibility tool: Steam Tinker Launch
* Launch the bat-Steam-game
* In the STL window click the `MAIN MENU` button (you have 2s to do this, then the game is automatically launched)
* Click on `GAME MENU`
* Turn on `Use custom command`
* Custom command: Select your LiveSplit.exe
* Enable `Fork custom command`
* Disable `Use Steam Linux Runtime with Custom Command`
* Enable `Inject custom command`
* Click `SAVE AND PLAY`
* Wait for the game and LiveSplit to start
* Verify that SST works (check for the console output or see if sst commands can be autocompleted)
  * If it crashes or SST doesn't work, use SST v0.5, v0.6-v0.8 don't work on Linux (v0.9 is not released as of 2024-11-20 but likely will work again)
    * [https://dl.mikes.software/sst/](https://dl.mikes.software/sst/)
    * Place the .dll in the SST folder
* Configure LiveSplit and verify that it works
  * Skytis had it already set up before from testing other stuff, so if weird stuff happens to you when configuring, maybe launch LiveSplit by itself to configure it

Notes

* If you quit the game first, LiveSplit freezes. You can just stop it via Steam
* If you quit LiveSplit first, then the game, everything should properly be shut down
* If you launch the bat-Steam-game and you don't get the STL launch dialog (where you can go to `MAIN MENU`), close LiveSplit and the game, then start `Steam Tinker Launch (Settings)` to edit stuff. It should have automatically selected the game you last launched (so the bat-Steam-game)
* Fonts don't work correctly, so stuff looks a little weird
* Sometimes LiveSplit doesn't start. No clue why
